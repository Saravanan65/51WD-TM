1:Object and it's internal representation in JS
-----------------------------------------------

1, Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

2, Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

Difference between http1 vs http2
----------------------------------

HTTP/1.1:

1, It works on the textual format.	
2, There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources
3, It uses requests resource Inclining for use getting multiple pages
4, It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2:
1, It works on the binary protocol.
2, It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3, It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
4, It uses HPACK for data compression.
