The key differences between the document object and the window object in JavaScript:

1. Scope:
=========
document Object:
----------------
     - Represents the global browser window or frame.
     - Encapsulates the entire browser environment.

document Object:
----------------
     - Represents the HTML document loaded in the window.
     - Limited to the content and structure of the specific HTML document.

2. Hierarchy:
============

window Object:
-------------
     - Serves as the top-level object in the browser environment.
     - Contains properties like location, history, and methods like setTimeout.

document Object:
----------------
     - Nested within the window object.
     - Represents the DOM (Document Object Model) of the HTML document.

3. Global Variables:
===================

window Object:
-------------
     - Variables declared without var, let, or const become properties of the window object.

document Object:
----------------
     - Does not serve as a global scope for variables; they are specific to the document.

4. Functionality:
=================

window Object:
-------------
     - Provides functionalities related to the browser environment.
     - Controls the browser window, navigation, and global events.

document Object:
----------------
     - Focuses on manipulating the content and structure of the HTML document.
     - Allows access to DOM elements and provides methods for interaction.

5. Global Methods:
==================

window Object:
-------------
     - Contains methods like alert(), confirm(), and setInterval().

document Object:
----------------
     - Primarily concerned with methods related to DOM manipulation, such as getElementById() and createElement().

6. Accessing Elements:
=====================

window Object:
-------------
     - Does not directly provide methods for accessing HTML elements.

document Object:
----------------
     - Provides methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and querySelector() for accessing and manipulating HTML elements.

7. Events:
===========

window Object:
-------------
     - Handles global events like resizing the window (window.onresize).

document Object:
----------------
     - Handles events related to the HTML document, such as clicks and keypresses (document.onclick, document.onkeypress).

8. Relationship:
================
   - While distinct, the document object is a property of the window object. You can access it through window.document.
